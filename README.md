# paragenix
Paragenix is an ionic app which can be used as a mobile application, web app, progressive web app and even a desktop app. Also with the help of Capacitor we don't even need to code a platform specific API which gives you the closest native app experience!

To view my app which is hosted on Firebase head over to -> https://paragenix-12147.firebaseapp.com/home

Don't forget to Inspect (Ctrl+Shift+I) as it is an app so obviously the pictures will look flattened if you view it on your desktop browser.

Using ionic not only was I able to make a webapp but also an android app (using [Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/) for native API calls), progressive web app (Using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)) and a desktop app (Using [electron](https://electronjs.org/)).
